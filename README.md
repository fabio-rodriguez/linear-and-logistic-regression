# machine-learning-module

In this project there is use examples of many machine learning and statistical techniques for solving data science problems on different R data sets. There are also use examples of techniques such as cross validation, bootstraping, and statistical analysis. 

1. 'bootstraping.R' : Practicing statistical bootstraping technique with random data

2. 'caret package.R' : Practicing with the caret package for predictions using the mnist_27 data set and the knn and loess techniques.

3. 'comparing linear and logistic regression.R' : Compare linear and logistic regression techniques using mnist data set 

4. 'knn numbers (2,7) predictor' : Using knn technique for classifiying numbers (2 or 7) using the minist_27 training data set.

5. 'linear regression for heights prediction.R' : Predicting height of the son based on the height of their father

6. 'logistic regression for sex prediction.R' : Predicting sex (male or female) based on the height of people

7. 'naive bayes, qda and lda models.R' : Practicing with prediction models and statistical measures using the confusion matrix. Predicting sex based on height with naive bayes and comparing qda and lda predicting numbers (2 or 7) classification. 

8. 'qda numbers predictor.R' : Using qda technique to make a numbers predictor using the minist data set.

9. 'knn, d-tree, r-tree and random-forest.R' : Using knn for prediction regions using the olive data set. Using the regression tree technique for predicting the margin in the polls_2008 data set, the cp is selected with cross validation. Comparing predictions from decision tree and random forest (with cross validation) models using the data in the mnist_27 data set.
