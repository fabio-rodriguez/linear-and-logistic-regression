# linear-and-logistic-regression

Using and comparing Linear and Logistic regression techniques with GaltonFamilies and MNIST data sets.

1. 'bootstraping.R' : Practicing statistical bootstraping technique with random data

2. 'caret package.R' : Practicing with the caret package for predictions using the mnist_27 data set and the knn and loess techniques.

3. 'comparing linear and logistic regression.R' : Compare linear and logistic regression techniques using mnist data set 

4. 'knn numbers (2,7) predictor' : Using knn technique for classifiying numbers (2 or 7) using the minist_27 training data set.

5. 'linear regression for heights prediction.R' : Predicting height of the son based on the height of their father

6. 'logistic regression for sex prediction.R' : Predicting sex (male or female) based on the height of people

7. 'naive bayes, qda and lda models.R' : Practicing with prediction models and statistical measures using the confusion matrix. Predicting sex based on height with naive bayes and comparing qda and lda predicting numbers (2 or 7) classification.
